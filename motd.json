  "message": "Greetings, Math Sprinters! 🚀 In this update, we've crunched the numbers and squared away some bugs – literally! The tutorial now adds up correctly, settings are multiplied by accessibility awesomeness, and we've divided the issues to conquer them all.\n\nBut wait, there's more: Imagine if π was exactly 3... chaos! Or if algebra was outlawed... no variables, just constants of fun! Keep sprinting through equations, because in the world of math, every problem has a solution – except maybe this MOTD's attempt at humor.\n\nHave feedback? [Share your thoughts with us](/feedback/) - we'd love to hear from you!\n\nHappy calculating! 🧮✨",
